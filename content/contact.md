Yamada lab is dedicated to elucidating the intricacies of metabolic regulation within the physiological system. We are particularly interested in how the liver's metabolic functions are governed by neural inputs. We employ a unique approach, combining metabolic analyses, genetic manipulation tools, and genetically engineered mouse models to investigate the intricate mechanisms underpinning systemic metabolism. Through a reverse physiological approach, we confront challenging yet essential questions, aiming to expand our understanding. Our lab fosters a creative, collaborative, and inclusive environment. We believe that such an atmosphere enhances the performance of all team members and leads to innovation. We are eager to welcome all the scientists who share our enthusiasm and joy for the scientific journey. 
If you are interested, please feel free to contact us!
